# Widgeme

This project is a simple SwiftUI application showcasing multiple widgets. The first
widget counts down the days left in the year. A second "Habit Progress" widget
displays your positive habit completions for the current week. A third "Habit Totals"
widget shows how many days you've completed each habit overall. A fourth "Habit Streak" widget displays your current streak. The app also
includes a small `HabitTracker` class which can store daily checkâ€‘ins using
CloudKit.

### Widget

The `DaysLeftWidget` displays the remaining days in the current year and
refreshes automatically every day. The `HabitProgressWidget` shows a single
habit with checkmarks for the last seven days so you can glance at your recent
streaks right from the home screen. The `HabitCompletionCountWidget` lists your
habits with the total number of days you've marked them complete. The `HabitStreakWidget` shows your current streak for one habit.

### Habit Tracking

`HabitTracker` provides a starting point for storing completed days in
CloudKit. You can now add custom habits and mark each one complete for the
current day. Each check-in is saved to CloudKit so your progress syncs across
devices. It can now calculate your current and longest streaks for each habit.

This repository only contains the Swift source files. You may need to open the
`Widgeme.xcodeproj` in Xcode and add a widget extension target to build the
widget on a device or simulator.
